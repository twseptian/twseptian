I am just an ordinary man who has a passion for information security and a heterogeneous network. I have completed a Master of Science (M.Sc) degree (2019) in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at National Taipei University of Technology, and I also received a bachelor's degree (S.Kom) (2013) in Computer Science at Universitas Sriwijaya.

My researches are archived on Google Scholar and Research Gate. If you are interested in my research, feel free to read and learn. If you have some questions/discussions, you can email me.

Let's make a friend, and follow my social media accounts, Linkedin, Github *this page, Twitter. My old Stories on Blogspot *not updated. CTF Platform HackTheBox, TryHackMe, Bug bounty program Bugcrowd.
